    "In this lab exercise, you will participate in a prediction challenge. You should work in a group of 3-5 students of your choice; you will only need to submit once as a group (see submission instructions below). Remember that labs are graded for sincere effort. In addition, the top three teams for today's challenge will receive bonus points for today's lab."

    "Until know, you have primarily experienced prediction with very structured data that was already formatted in a convenient way for applying machine learning algorithms. In practice, however, we often get a variety of data from different sources, and it is not immediately clear what information is useful for the prediction task, or how to use it. In this prediction challenge, we will work with the MovieLens dataset from HW 4. Recall that it contained about 100,000 ratings (on a 1 to 5 scale) of 1,682 movies by 943 users. The information we are given is contained in three tables or dataframes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `df_users` (the `u.user` file) contains demographic information about each of the 943 users.\n",
    "- `df_movies` (the `u.item` file) contains basic identifying and genre information for each of the 1,682 movies.\n",
    "- `df_train_ratings` (the `train_ratings.csv` file) contains 70,050 ratings: each row identifies a particular user who rated a particular movie with a particular score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to use this information to predict the 29,950 ratings in the `test_ratings.csv` file (which will be provided 20 minutes before the end of lab). Just as in `df_train_ratings`, for each rating we want to predict, we will be told the `user_id` and `movie_id` and asked to predict how that particular user would rate that particular movie. You may assume that all users and movies in the test set also appear in `df_users` and `df_movies`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will measure the error of our predicted ratings as the root-mean-square error (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation), and maintain a leaderboard of the teams with the lowest error so far. The three teams with the lowest error predictions on the leaderboard with 5 minutes before the end of lab will receive bonus points for today's lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use anything in standard Python, Numpy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and your own previous labs and homeworks to help you, but you may not use code from outside of these sources. Code showing how to measure error is provided below, good luck!"

    "Not surprisingly, random guessing is not incredibly accurate. To measure the root-mean-square error using scikit-learn, we simply use the metrics.mean_squared_error function (recall HW 6) but pass the parameter `squared=False`. This means that we take the square root of the mean-square error, which makes the error on the same scale as te data. So the error of about 1.89 above means that on average, our random guesses were about 1.89 off from the true rating. Try to build a model that does better by using the data in the training set. Be careful though not to overfit; the final measurement of error will be on the test data set you haven't seen yet. Feel free to make fractional predictions (i.e., you can predict a rating of 3.64 for a movie if you like)."

    "2. You will download two versions of your notebook to submit, a .pdf and a .py. To create a PDF, we reccomend that you select File --> Download as --> HTML (.html). Open the downloaded .html file; it should open in your web broser. Double check that it looks like your notebook, then print a .pdf using your web browser (you should be able to select to print to a pdf on most major web browsers and operating systems). Check your .pdf for readability: If some long cells are being cut off, go back to your notebook and split them into multiple smaller cells. Also, make sure that it is a reasonable length; print statements which are truncated inside of the notebook may come to many pages in the pdf. To get the .py file from your notebook, simply select File -> Download as -> Python (.py).\n",
