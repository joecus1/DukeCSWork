    "# Part 1: Getting Started with Numpy\n",
    "Numpy is the standard library for scientific computing with Python, and Numpy arrays are the standard data structure for working with prediction tasks in Python. If you are unfamiliar with Numpy, we reccomend that you start this assignment by reviewing the brief tutorial on Numpy at http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/#numpy (just the Numpy section). The Numpy documentation itself also contains an expanded tutorial https://numpy.org/doc/1.17/user/quickstart.html. We mention a few particularly important notes here.\n",
    "- You can easily turn any Python list into a Numpy array (for example, ar = numpy.array([0,1,2]) creates a Numpy array named ar containing 1, 2, and 3).\n",
    "- Indexing and slicing 1-d Numpy arrays is similar to indexing and slicing Python lists. For example, ar[1:] returns [1,2]. \n",
    "- Indexing and slicing 2-d Numpy arrays is similar to using the `.iloc` method on a Pandas dataframe. For example, if you have a 2-d Numpy array Mat and you want the entry for row 0, column 5, you would just index Mat[0,5]. If you want column 5, you just write Mat[:,5]. \n",
    "- Operations on Numpy arrays are element-wise *by default*. For example, ar+5 would return [5, 6, 7]. ar+ar would return [0, 2, 4]. \n",
    "- Building on the element-wise theme, writing a boolean condition will return a True/False array. For example, ar==1 would return [False, True, False].\n",
    "- Similar to Pandas filtering, you can use a boolean mask of this sort to filter a Numpy array. For example, ar[ar >= 1] would return [1, 2].\n",
    "- Numpy comes with full support for nearly all mathematical computing needs. You can find the reference documentation at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference. Of particular interest are the many mathematical functions implemented in Numpy https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.math and the many random sampling functions implemented in Numpy https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/random/index."

More concretely, you should compute an array of the same length as `y_test` where for each entry, your prediction is a `1` or `0`. Do so by selecting, for each data point, the class (1 or 0) that maximizes the above likelihood under the independence assumption of the Naive Bayes classifier.

The measurements (the first four columns) are all physical measurements in centimeters, and the flower types are designated by 0, 1, and 2 in the rightmost column. Our goal is to predict the flower type from measurements of the physical dimensions of the flower. Note that unlike in Parts 1 and 2, our features are no longer categorial, but instead are numerical.

    "1. Double check that you have written all of your answers along with your supporting work in this notebook. Make sure you save the complete notebook.\n",
    "1. Double check that your entire notebook runs correctly and generates the expected output. To do so, you can simply select Kernel -> Restart and Run All. \n",
    "2. You will download two versions of your notebook to submit, a .pdf and a .py. To create a PDF, we reccomend that you select File --> Download as --> HTML (.html). Open the downloaded .html file; it should open in your web broser. Double check that it looks like your notebook, then print a .pdf using your web browser (you should be able to select to print to a pdf on most major web browsers and operating systems). Check your .pdf for readability: If some long cells are being cut off, go back to your notebook and split them into multiple smaller cells. To get the .py file from your notebook, simply select File -> Download as -> Python (.py) (note, we recognize that you may not have written any Python code for this assignment, but will continue the usual workflow for consistency). \n",
    "3. Upload the .pdf to gradescope under hw 5 report and the .py to gradescope under hw 5 code. If you work with a partner, only submit one document for both of you, but be sure to add your partner using the [group feature on gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/help#help-center-item-student-group-members)."
