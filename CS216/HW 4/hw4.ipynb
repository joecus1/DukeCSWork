    "Suppose that we take 150 students and randomly assign them to groups of 5 students each by the following procedure. First, we generate a uniform random permutation of the students (that is, a random ordering where for a given student there is an equal probability of appearing at any position in the ordering from 1, 2, 3, ..., 150). Then we simply assign the first five students in the ordering to the first group, the second five to the second group, and so on. Compute the following probabilities.\n",

Check your .pdf for readability: If some long cells are being cut off, go back to your notebook and split them into multiple smaller cells.
