    "# Lab 1: Wrangling and Exploring Data\n",
    "In this lab exercise, you will build on HW 1 to practice some more data wrangling for exploratory data analysis. You should work in a group of 4-5 students of your choice; you will only need to submit once as a group (see submission instructions below). Remember that labs are graded for sincere effort: if you do not finish the entire lab assignment before the end of class, turn in what you have so far. \n",

    "You are welcome to use whatever tools you deem helpful. In particular, you have practiced using regular expressions to search and extract text, OpenRefine for cleaning and refining datasets, Pandas for working with structured data in Python, and programming in Python itself. You are encouraged to use documentation and other references to learn new features and functionalities of these powerful tools as they become necessary for the task at hand.\n",

Along with partners, they curate a publicly available dataset containing, among other things, information on all current members of the U.S. Congress: https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators. Pull the legislators-current file from the repository. It is available in different formats: the master branch maintains it as a .yaml file, but if you scroll down it is also available as a .json or .csv; the choice is up to you."

So for each combination of party affiliation (Republicans, Democrats, and Independents) and chamber of the congress (house and senate), find the longest serving current member (more precisely, the member of that party affiliation and chamber who has served in that chamber for the longest).
