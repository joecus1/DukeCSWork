We strongly reccomend that you go through these exercises and tutorials in Parts 1 through 3 first before moving on to the problems in Parts 4 and 5. You can include all of your answers (either text written in Markdown cells or code written in code cells) within this notebook.

    "As discussed in class, regular expressions are a formal language for specifying strings of characters. That can be very helpful when wrangling and cleaning data, so you should start by practicing to get some basic familiarity with regular expressions. Review the materials from lecture, then go to [regex101.com](https://regex101.com). You should see an interactive console that allows you to practice regular expressions (feel free to switch to the Python flavor in the bottom left if you prefer; note that the regular expressions themselves are the same regardless).\n",

    "1. First, go to [pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) and read the section titled 10 minutes to Pandas. Note that this page also gives the official documentation for any other functions in Pandas you might need to use.\n",
    "2. (optional) If you would like to use Pandas instead of OpenRefine for the later parts of the assignment, you may want to read more about how to use it to wrangle and clean data. You can check out chapter 4 on Pandas from [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/), which comes with Jupyter notebooks to follow along in examples. For an even shorter and more specific tutorial, try this [data cleaning article](https://realpython.com/python-data-cleaning-numpy-pandas/), which also has a linked Jupyter notebook where you can follow along. If you prefer to use a graphical interface for wrangling and cleaning data in this assignment, feel free to skip this second step and go straight to the OpenRefine tutorial in Part 3.\n",

    "\n",
    "Data often comes along messy. Either people make mistakes entering and collecting data, or the data you got is in the wrong format for what you want to do with it.  [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) is a powerful data wrangling tool that  was built to deal with these kinds of problems and to bring data into the shape you need, all inside of a graphical user interface designed to make it more accessible. For completing the subsequent parts of the assignment, you may wish to use OpenRefine instead of Python and Pandas. We particularly reccomend that you use OpenRefine if you are still getting used to programming in Python. Regardless, in this part you should try out OpenRefine to add an additional tool to your data cleaning toolbox. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, visit the OpenRefine website and watch the short videos on exploring data and cleaning & transforming data. These will introduce you to the OpenRefine design and functionality. \n",
    "2. Next, install OpenRefine. Visit http://openrefine.org/download.html and download the kit for your operating system.\n",
    "3. Finally, complete the short step by step OpenRefine tutorial included in the box folder for this assignment (just open the .html file to view the tutorial in your web browser). (This tutorial originally came from http://unurl.org/cbclean. It has been cleaned up and modified a bit.)\n",
    "4. (optional) If you would like even more tutorials on using OpenRefine, feel free to browse the extensive curated list of tutorials maintained by the developers: https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/External-Resources. \n",
